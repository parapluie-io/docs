## Why Parapluie exist

The motivation behind creating Parapluie stems from a crucial need in the developer community: an effortless and efficient way to safeguard public APIs. Public APIs are susceptible to misuse, either from malicious users or inadvertent bugs within the code. Such scenarios can result in excessive requests being sent to the server, leading to unexpectedly high cloud service bills.

### Key Motivations

#### Preventing Financial Surprises
Without proper safeguards, an infinite loop or excessive request generation can quickly inflate cloud service costs. Parapluie implements robust rate limiting to ensure that even in the event of abuse or an accidental infinite loop, your API remains protected from generating excessive and costly traffic.

#### Simplified Setup
Many existing solutions for API protection are complex and require significant setup and maintenance. Parapluie is designed to be simple and quick to deploy, enabling developers to add a layer of protection without extensive configuration or management overhead.

#### Peace of Mind
Knowing that your API is shielded from potential misuse allows you to focus on developing features and improving your product, rather than constantly monitoring for unusual traffic patterns and potential billing spikes.

With Parapluie, you can ensure that your API usage remains within safe limits, protecting both your resources and your budget from unexpected and potentially disruptive surprises.
