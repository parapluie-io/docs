Parapluie features IP whitelisting, allowing developers to specify a set of trusted IP addresses that are permitted to access their API. By default, all other IP addresses will be denied, enhancing security and controlling access. 

This ensures that only authorized users or systems can make requests to the API, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential abuse. With IP whitelisting, developers can effectively safeguard their API while maintaining tight control over who can interact with it.
